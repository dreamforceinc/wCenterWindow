# wCenterWindow
This program centers the current active window by a 'LCTRL + LWIN + C' hotkey.

You can use 'LCTRL + LWIN + I' hotkey for hide/show trayicon.

You can also use commandline option '/hide' for hide trayicon at startup.

'Use workarea' option means that the window is centered without a taskbar, otherwise, the full resolution of the monitor will be used."
